Many investors analyse stocks based on their fundamentals - such as their revenue, valuation, or industry trends - but fundamental factors aren’t always 
reflected in the market price. Technical analysis seeks to predict price movements by examining historical data, mainly price and volume. Using historical 
data or charts may seem frightening to new traders initially, but they should learn how technical analysis offers insight into market behavior in order to 
identify potential profit opportunities. Ideally they should focus on one specific trading approach and develop a well planned strategy that you can follow 
without any emotions clouding your judgement. A good example on how you could this is to find a broker that helps you accomplish your plan carefully and 
successfully with the right tools and resources. For instance, if the short-term 50 day average goes above the long term 200-day moving averages, it indicates
an upward price trend and generates a buy signal. The opposite is true for a sell signal.
